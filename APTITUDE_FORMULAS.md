## 1️⃣ Quantitative Aptitude

### Arithmetic
- **Percentages**
  - Percentage = (Value / Total) × 100
  - Profit% = ((SP - CP) / CP) × 100
  - Loss% = ((CP - SP) / CP) × 100
  - Simple Interest (SI) = (P × R × T) / 100
  - Compound Interest (CI) = P × (1 + R/100)^T - P

- **Averages**
  - Average = (Sum of terms) / (Number of terms)

- **Ratio & Proportion**
  - If a : b = m : n → a = km, b = kn

- **Time, Speed, Distance**
  - Distance = Speed × Time
  - Relative speed (same direction) = (a - b)
  - Relative speed (opposite direction) = (a + b)

- **Work & Time**
  - Work = Rate × Time
  - If A completes work in x days → Efficiency = 1/x

- **Pipes & Cisterns**
  - Filling pipe = +ve rate
  - Emptying pipe = -ve rate
  - Net Rate = Fill rate - Empty rate

- **Mixtures (Allegation Rule)**
  - (C1 - Mean) / (Mean - C2) = Ratio

---

### Number System
- **Divisibility Rules**
  - ÷2 → last digit even
  - ÷3 → sum of digits divisible by 3
  - ÷5 → last digit 0 or 5
  - ÷11 → difference of (sum of odd - even digits) divisible by 11

- **LCM × HCF = Product of Numbers**

---

### Algebra & Equations
- (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b²
- (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b²
- (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b²
- (x - a)(x - b) = x² - (a+b)x + ab

---

### Geometry & Mensuration
- **Triangles**
  - Area = (1/2) × base × height
  - Heron’s Formula = √(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)), where s = (a+b+c)/2

- **Circle**
  - Area = πr²
  - Circumference = 2πr

- **Rectangle**
  - Area = l × b
  - Perimeter = 2(l + b)

- **Square**
  - Area = a²
  - Perimeter = 4a

- **Cylinder**
  - TSA = 2πr(h + r)
  - Volume = πr²h

- **Cone**
  - Volume = (1/3)πr²h
  - Slant height = √(r² + h²)

- **Sphere**
  - Volume = (4/3)πr³
  - Surface Area = 4πr²

---

### Probability & Permutations
- Probability = Favourable / Total
- Permutations (nPr) = n! / (n-r)!
- Combinations (nCr) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)

---

## 2️⃣ Logical Reasoning

### Common Tricks
- **Series (Numbers/Letters)** → Check difference, squares, primes.
- **Coding-Decoding** → Shift letters, reverse, ASCII patterns.
- **Blood Relations**
  - Draw family tree.
  - Keep track: Father, Mother, Son, Daughter.
- **Directions**
  - Always keep initial facing direction fixed (North).
- **Syllogism**
  - Venn diagram method is safest.

## 3️⃣ Verbal Ability

### Grammar Quick Rules
- Subject + Verb agreement (He runs, not He run).
- Tenses → Keep consistency.
- Articles: a, an, the.
- Prepositions: in, on, at, by, with.
- Commonly confused:
  - Affect (verb) vs Effect (noun)
  - Their / There / They’re

### Reading Comprehension
- Skim for keywords.
- Eliminate extreme options first.

## 4️⃣ Programming Concepts

### Basics
- Data Types: int, float, char, string, boolean.
- Loops: for, while.
- Conditionals: if-else, switch.

### Time Complexity
- Array access → O(1)
- Linear Search → O(n)
- Binary Search → O(log n)
- Sorting:
  - Bubble/Insertion/Selection → O(n²)
  - Merge/Quick Sort → O(n log n)

### Common Patterns
- **Swap**
